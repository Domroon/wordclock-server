## ToDo

### v0.2.0

- [ ] Update the base image to latest linux and python version
- [ ] Implement simple endpoint that sends a version-number that is in a config-file for test purposes
- [ ] The WordClock should be able to get that version-number in boot.py

### v0.3.0

- [ ] make folders that contains files that represents a software version
- [ ] each software-version should have a endpoint that is named like the software version
- [ ] the word clock should be able to download all the files from that endpoint
